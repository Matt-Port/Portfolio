Matt-Port's Portfolio:
======================

This project contains a website for a portfolio consisting of an HTML and a CSS file largely. This was the first ever HTML and CSS project I have ever attempted, and I am personally very proud of what I have managed to do using only resources available online - with a large credit to w3schools.com which documents very well the properties of the languages.
The website aims to be an updatable touchstone of my portfolio and work so far as well as a place to put devlogs and other passion projects that may be professionally relevant.
