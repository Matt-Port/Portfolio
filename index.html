				Hello! I'm Matthew Griffin and I'm a <strong>Computer Science</strong> and <strong>Mathematics</strong> graduate from the University of Birmingham currently based in <strong>Birmingham, UK</strong>.
				I am a professional software engineer with a passion for designing and developing games and creative content for people to enjoy! <br> <br>
				After graduation, I have been working on a project to simulate a small solar system with movement and exploration that hopes to draw players into an engaging environment.<br> <br>
				In the future I am looking to join in with more <strong>game jams</strong> as and when I can to help develop smaller projects that will expand my horizons to other genres quickly in bite-sized workloads. 
				I love working on game projects and in this sector and wish to keep growing my skillset through a fulfilling career!

		<!-- Improve first update -->
		<p><br>Pictured below is my first ever attempted project in Godot, the UFO player model was also my first ever Blender model, and pictured is a basic test scene for 
		flight and simulating 0-gravity, as well as smoothing motion and other movement tweaks. <br>
