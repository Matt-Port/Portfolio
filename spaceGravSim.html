						My aims for this project:
					</h3>
					<p style="padding-left: 4vw; padding-right: 7vw;" >
						&emsp; In my first ever project I am hoping to at least create a solar system and player who can get in their ship to explore multiple
						different planets and environments. On top of that, having the solar system orbit its sun properly and having a
						dynamic light and shadows system.
						<br>
						&emsp; In terms of <b>gameplay</b>, I would like it to mainly focus on exploration - similar to Outer Wilds - but I would also like for the
						world to persist and want to represent cycles through farming and collection. I want the planet environments to undergo small changes as they orbit
						e.g. snow or new plant life.
						<br>
						&emsp; As the player brings things to their ship after collecting, like crops for example, they can bring them back to their ship - which will 
						have its own small gravitational pull - and would be able to stack them outside the ship to form a big uncontainable collection that might
						grow out of control! This idea is not crucial to the image of the game but is something that I think might make the farming aspect more
						interesting if the environment that the crop has to grow in needs to change drastically between plants.
						<br>
						&emsp; Overall, I hope my aims for this beginner project are not too high and I am willing to cut a lot of features to avoid scope creeping
						too large, but I believe that the core idea for the game is something I can pull off and I know would enjoy playing myself!

						<p>&emsp; In the initial few weeks of starting this project in Godot, 
						I created a UFO player model in blender to fly around the scene, as shown in the screenshot. My early aims were only to create 
						an object that could fly around and collide with obstacles in the scene at a very basic level,
						as well as smoothing motion, correcting model rotations, and other minor tweaks.
						<br>
						&emsp; While these first few steps felt small, since this is my first time using Godot it also is helping to lay the groundwork for my understanding
						of not only the software but the development process itself.

							&emsp; After creating the basic scene, I made some alterations to the skybox and other aesthetic changes. Then, in the weeks following 
							that, I kept tweaking the movement system and allowed the player to roll the ship along all 3 axes, giving for more fine control - which I
							<i>love</i>  about 0-gravity movement systems. 
							<br>
							&emsp; With the floating space-like movements now implemented in a basic form, I moved
							on to adding gravitational pulls to planets. By creating a 3D area around the spherical planets to detect entry of objects 
							on the player layer, each planet can send a value for gravity to accelerate the ship to the movement controls, once in its range 
							- however this system needs more fine tuning at this stage and should act in a more realistic and expected way.
							<br> <br>
							&emsp; Next I hope to add a true player character that can get out of the ship and walk around -  then I can add structures to
							the planets that can be walked through and explored.
